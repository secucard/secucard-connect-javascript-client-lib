## Versioning and preparing release

* prepare ``gulp prepare-release --sem patch``, possible values for --sem option: `major` (1.0.0), `minor` (0.1.0), `patch` (0.0.2), `prerelease` (0.0.1-pre.2)
* bump version ``gulp pre-release --sem prerelease``, possible values for --sem option: `major` (1.0.0), `minor` (0.1.0), `patch` (0.0.2), `prerelease` (0.0.1-pre.2)

## Pull Requests

- **Comment your code**

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.


**Happy coding**!
